# BreatheandRelax
My first Android application. This app is a simple way to help guide your breathing in order to relax.

The app features three activities: a splash page, a settings activity (which utilizes a SettingsFragment), 
and the main breathing activity, which consists of an animation to time your breathing and a timer.

The app can be customized to vary your experience. The ratios between inhaling, holding, exhaling, and 
pausing between breaths can be modified to comfort. In addition, the animation colors for inhalation and
exhalation can be changed, as can the animation itself. 

Currently working on an update to introduce sound cues for breathing and improve the layout of the settings activity.
